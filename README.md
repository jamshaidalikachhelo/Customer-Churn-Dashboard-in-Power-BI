I've always believed that learning doesn't just happen in the classroom; it's when we roll up our sleeves and dive into real projects that we truly grow. With that spirit in mind, I'm excited to share some cool stuff we've discovered from our customer churn analysis using data from Databel Telegram Company in the USA.



1. 𝗖𝗵𝘂𝗿𝗻 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: Our analysis found that a lot of customers, about 27%, are leaving. That's a big deal and something we need to pay attention to.



2. 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀: We noticed that people in California (CA) are leaving more often than in other places. This tells us we might need to do some extra work to keep customers there happy.



3. 𝗔𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀: Younger people, especially those who pay month-to-month, are leaving more than others. This means we need to think about what these younger customers want and find ways to keep them happy.



4. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗲𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀: A big reason people are leaving is because our competitors are offering better deals. So, we need to stay sharp and make sure we're giving our customers the best.



By using these insights, we can come up with better ways to keep our customers happy and stick around for the long haul. Our dashboard is helping us figure out what's going on and how we can make things better.
